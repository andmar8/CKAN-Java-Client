JCKANClient
====

__A (very much) work in progress__

Provides an interface to a [CKAN 1.8](http://ckan.org) installation.

Major update of code to follow... if I can get the ckan dev list to work :(

-------

Notes to self:

Add factory/ies for results... and maybe for requests too?
Add param objects or keep overloaded methods?
Refactor code again once the API methods are complete
Some people are prob not gonna like Allman braces/indenting in java
